# Image classification using ResNetX

Image classification in PyTorch for ImageNet using ResNetX

## Design

### Encoder

* Stem
* Body

### Decoder

* Head 

### Building Blocks

* Serial
* Parallel
* Dense
* Residual

## Objective

* A comprehensive look at training methods for improving convergence and improving generalization via regularization.
* A practical look at implementation including methods for estimating performance and methods for improving network training.

## Goal

Use the above techniques to design, train and estimate the complexity of a CNN for image classification
